## 🧠 About Me

I am a final-year Computer Science student focused on developing strong foundations in software engineering, backend systems, and database-driven applications.

I learn by building complete, deployable projects — from frontend interfaces to backend APIs and database integration — while maintaining clean architecture and version control practices.

Currently, I am:
- Building full-stack applications using React, Next.js, and Node.js
- Strengthening backend architecture and REST API design
- Working with SQL databases and authentication systems
- Improving code quality, documentation, and deployment workflows
